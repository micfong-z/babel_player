*A music player made using [egui](https://egui.rs), with multilingual word-by-word translation support.*

Note that this is stripped from a larger workspace project, so some error handling could be broken, and there could be some confusing loose ends in the codebase.

This is more of a proof-of-concept project ;)

## Usage

A music file and a corresponding lyrics file are required to play a song.

The lyrics file should be a JSON file exported from the lyrics editor. To make your own word-by-word translations, you should start by importing an [AMLL TTML](https://github.com/Steve-xmh/amll-ttml-tool) file.
